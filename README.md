## Introduction

This repository showcases **Materials Science** modeling for mechanical systems like **pendulums** and **shock absorbers**. By leveraging computational tools such as Python, we can simulate their motion and predict their physical behavior under different conditions. The repository includes:
- **Pendulum system analysis**: Simulating pendulum motion and forces.
- **Shock absorber modeling**: Exploring the behavior of damped oscillations in mechanical systems.
- **Flowcharts**: Algorithm visualizations to represent system processes.

## Pendulum System Modeling

The pendulum is a classic example used in physics to demonstrate simple harmonic motion. This repository includes detailed visualizations and simulations of pendulum motion, including forces acting on the pendulum at different points in its swing.

Explore the simulations in the provided Jupyter Notebook file: [Materials Modeling for Materials Science.ipynb](./Materials Modeling for Materials Science.ipynb).

## Shock Absorber System

The **shock absorber** system models the damping and oscillation behavior of mechanical systems. The repository includes a visual representation of a shock absorber, as well as computational methods for simulating its damped motion.

The system helps understand how mechanical energy is dissipated and how damping affects oscillations in real-world systems, such as vehicle suspension.

## Flowchart and Algorithm

The algorithm and flowchart provided in this repository visually represent the process for simulating motion, such as in the pendulum system. It outlines the steps involved in computing displacement, velocity, and acceleration over time.
